Git: (Version control system)

-->To track changes
-->Undo changes
-->comapre versions
-->work with others

git is free and opensource, we can download in our computer
git is completly free locally, and use it to track changes on your local files on your own computer

***====>However if you want  to host your code on the internet, its typically easier to use a hosting service like github
 github owned by microsoft
 allows you to have versions of your code "live" on the internet-->for you and for others
 -->to access
 -->to update
 -->change from any machine
 
 
 github Vs git
 
 git: opensource VCS software
 github:company that offers a service for hosting files on the internet that are managed using git
 
 github is the online hosting provider, that can acts as a machine connected to our local system via internet and host the code repository for us
 
 finally git allows you to save points to your work, create changes, update existing code, undo changes, create brances for others to work and merge work together
 
 
 Git or git
 
 Git:typically refers to entire project
 git: is the actual program used
 
 there has been deeper integration between github and microsoft products -->including connecting to github directly within visual studio code,a code editor tool from microsoft
 
 Github features:
  -->graphical interfaces of many git features
  -->An online hosted repository also provides an ideal connection point between  everyone working on the same project.
  
  
Steps:-
=====

1.install git in respective os
2.Create github account free tier one
3.install github desktop and vs code

4.configure github
  to check current configuration with commands
  git config user.name
  git config user.email
  
  To set configuration ,commands will been
  git config --global user.name "sravanthi3012"
  git config --global user.email "gantasravanthi09@gmail.com"
  
  
  
  
Repository:the main place we track changes and manage our files that are using git is called a repository

Starting with git:
------------------
git init :this command initilizes a git repository in your local machine -- you only need to run once per project

Upon creating a repository with git init , you will create a hidden .git file -- that manages the versioning of the files inside the git repository.
 means upon creating a git repository, all the folders/directories inside the top leavel git repository also be tracked.
 
we can also use the graphical user interface with github desktop or even we can create a new repository online at www.github.com 
-- Then we can git clone this repository to our local machine

git status :this command will report back status of your repository


Tasks:
1.create our first local git repository at the command line
git init
2.then we will create repository in github  and use git clone  to clone it to our local computer

for that you need to setup some tokens in order to clone private repositories 
 
 
Private Repositories and tokens:
================================

We can easily clone other public repositories with the git clone command and then https url for public repository.
Now explore hoe to deal with private repositories we wish to clone

option1: command line :
		create personal access tokens(PAT) on github.com
		when using git clone command reference the PAT.
		
		profile--settings--developer settings -- personal access tokens -- generate new token -- provide password  --fill all parameters --generate token --copy the token to some file--it will be visble once 

clone syntax with PAT
git clone https://token(PAT)@github.com/account/repo.git
privisouly : git clone https://github.com/account/repo.git
		
		
		
option2: Github desktop tool gui
		open the github desktop tool gui:login with username and pw
		clone repo via gui
